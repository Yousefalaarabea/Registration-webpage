# Registration-webpage

Design a registration web page that inserts a user data into MySQL database, the details are as follow: 1. The form includes a user personal detail: full_name, user_name, birthdate, phone, address,  password, confirm_password, user_image, and email. Use three appropriate client-side  validations. (All fields mandatory, email and birthdate and full_name are correct types,  password match with confirm_password and is at least 8 characters with at least 1 number  literal and 1 special character) [Client-side VALIDATIONs] 2. Include a header and footer pages of your own design inside the registration webpage.  3. Maintain a User’s table in the database to check if the username is not registered before. If the  user inputs a username that exists before, the form alerts the user to choose another username [Server-side VALIDATIONs] 4. Upload the user image (the image will be stored on the server, while the image name is stored  in the database). 5. Beside the birthdate field add a button that checks actors born in the same day using a thirdparty MDBI API “https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/” (shown in the figure below) You need to show the list with actor’s names born on the same day. Hint: using the “actors/list-born-today” endpoint retrieves a list of actors born in a same input day.  Using the “actors/get-bio” endpoint retrieves actor details by passing an actor ID.
